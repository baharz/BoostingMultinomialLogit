% OUTPUT FILE
% Put the name you want for your output file (including full path if not the current 
% working directory) after words "delete" and "diary".
% The 'diary off' and 'delete filename' commands close and delete the previous version 
% of the file created during your current matlab session or in any previous sessions. 
% If you want to append the new output to the old output, then 
% put % in front of the 'diary off' and 'delete filename' commands (or erase them).

diary off
delete myrun.out
diary myrun.out

% TITLE
% Put a title for the run in the quotes below, to be printed at the top of the output file.


% DATA
        

% Number of choice situations in dataset.
NCS=0.5*NCS1;     

% Total number of alternatives in all choice situations combined.
% This is the number of rows of data in XMAT below.

NROWS=NCS;

% Load and/or create XMAT, a matrix that contains the data.
%
% XMAT must contain one row of data for each alternative in each choice situation.
% The rows are grouped by choice situations.
% The number of rows in XMAT must be NROWS, specified above.
% The columns in XMAT are variable that describe the alternative.
% 
% The *first* column of XMAT identifies the choice situation. 
% The choice situations must be numbered sequentially from 1 to NCS, in ascending order.
% The *second* column of XMAT identifies the alternative for each choice situation.
% All alternatives for a given choice situation must be grouped together.
% The *third* column of XMAT identifies the chosen alternatives (1 for
% chosen, 0 for not). One and only one alternative must be chosen for each
% choice situation.
% The remaining columns of XMAT can be any variables.

% XMAT=load('datalong.asc');  %The variables are described below

%XMAT(:,4:5)=XMAT(:,4:5)./100; %To scale: costs in hundreds of dollars

% 1. idcase: gives the observation number (1-900)
% 2. idalt: gives the alternative number (1-5)
% 3. depvar: identifies the chosen alternative (1=chosen, 0=nonchosen)
% 4. ic: installation cost of system, in hundreds of dollars
% 5. oc: operating cost of the system, in hundreds of dollars
% 6. income is the annual income of the household
% 7. agehed is the age of the household head
% 8. rooms is the number of rooms in the house
% 9. ncostl identifies whether the house is in the northern coastal region
% 10. scostl identifies whether the house is in the southern coastal region
% 11. mountn identifies whether the house is in the mountain region
% 12. valley identifies whether the house is in the central valley region

%Identify the columns of XMAT that you want to enter as explanatory variables in the model.


%Give names to the variables. Put the names in single quotes.'}

NAMES={'Bikes'	'public tranist'	'residential type'	'Home Ownership'	'income'	'hh size'	'hh Employment'	'hh students' 'hh drivering licence holders' };



%Gives starting values for the coefficients of these variables.


B=randn(1,length(IDV));

%Do you want to predict probabilities and aggregate shares for each alternative?
%Predicted shares are given for each unique value (ie alternative number) in the second column of XMAT.
%Predicted probabilities for each alternative in each choice situation are held in vector probs, which is NROWSx1.
%Set PREDICT=0 to estimate only and not predict
%    PREDICT=1 to estimate the model and then predict at the estimated coefficients
%    PREDICT=2 to predict at the starting values B and not estimate

PREDICT=1;

% OPTIMIZATION 
% Maximum number of iterations for the optimization routine.
% The code will abort after ITERMAX iterations, even if convergence has
% not been achieved. The default is 400, which is used when MAXITERS=[];
MAXITERS=[];

% Convergence criterion based on the maximum change in parameters that is considered
% to represent convergence. If all the parameters change by less than PARAMTOL 
% from one iteration to the next, then the code considers convergence to have been
% achieved. The default is 0.000001, which is used when PARAMTOL=[];
PARAMTOL=[];

% Convergence criterion based on change in the log-likelihood that is
% considered to represent convergence. If the log-likelihood value changes
% less than LLTOL from one iteration to the next, then the optimization routine
% considers convergence to have been achieved. The default is 0.000001,
% which is used when LLTOL=[];
LLTOL=[];

%Do not change the next line. It runs the model.
